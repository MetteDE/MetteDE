Hey, it's me. Mette! 

I'm a 16 year old student from Germany who is exploring the world of programming and how an operating system works. I hope I can learn some stuff about these topics and gain experience by joining this community. Apart from coding and gaming, I enjoy listening to music, go inline skating and read lots of books in my freetime.  

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in all kind of programming 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning low level stuff 
- ðŸ“« Contact me on Discord Mette#3003
